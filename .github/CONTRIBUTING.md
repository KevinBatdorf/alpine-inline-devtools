# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [an issue](https://github.com/KevinBatdorf/alpine-inline-devtools/issues) to first discuss any significant new features. This includes bug fixes, features, themes, etc.

## Theming

Currently, adding a theme involves duplicating an existing theme and updating the Tailwind config file inside the theme folder. This will later be expanded to override classnames entirely for more custom theming.
